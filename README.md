<h1>Active Directory â€“ Adding a user to the domain</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I created two virtual machines, a windows server and a PC. I added Active Directory to the server and promoted it to a domain controller(DC). I assigned IPs to both the PC and the DC to put them on the same network. This allowed me to connect the PC to the domain.

I created an organizational unit called IT and added Bob Tame as a user.
